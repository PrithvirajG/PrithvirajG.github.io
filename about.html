                HI EVERYONE!<br>
                Welcome. <br>This is a place where we share virtual labs with the world 
				In this Pandemic Situation, almost every institute has turned down the on Campus education and thus students can’t get access to the institute’s Lab equipment to gain experience. 
				Even in situation without Lockdown, there are people who need access to high quality lab equipment for research, experimentation or to gain some on hand experience. Due to the very high cost of such lab equipment very few institutes around the world actually have these high quality equipment in their Lab. 
				Thus to gain access to such Lab equipment and perform your own experiment independently at lesser expense we need a system which provides Remote Access to such labs and allow the user to control their lab equipment as per the requirement of their project, research or experiment.
				This system will provide a lot of opportunities for students as well with cost effectiveness and thus saving time as well.

            </p>
            <p>Physical laboratory exercises are the most critical gap in Distance Learning education today . <br>
                While there has been an increase in development of individual online laboratories, little has been done to develop sets of Remote Laboratories to accommodate entire courses or programs. <br>
                The ability to provide these is of key importance to institutions offering distance learning programs in major engineering disciplines and/or cross-disciplinary short courses in the educational service sector.<br>
                The aim of this work is the implementation of a remote laboratory so as to provide students access to expensive laboratory equipment, that are usually unavailable<br>
