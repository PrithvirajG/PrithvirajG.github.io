	This Experiment carried out through  is a simple project which operates a brushless fan when the temperature in 
    a particular area goes above a set point, when temperature return normal, fan could be turned off. The project setup 
    is built using arduino and LM35 temperature Sensor. Project requires 12V DC supply and can drive 12V Fan. This project 
    is useful in application like Heat sink temperature controller, PC, heat sensitive equipment, Power supply, Audio Amplifiers, 
    Battery chargers etc.
